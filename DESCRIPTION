Version: 0.1.0
Author: Elizabeth Stroud
Maintainer: <elizabeth.stroud@arch.ox.ac.uk>
Description: This package contains function for the linear discriminant anaylsis of ethnographic data agaisint which archaeobotanical data can be classified. The attributes of the weed seeds are used within the linear discriminant anaylsis and allows for archaeobotical datasets to be classified as one crop processing stages the weed seeds attributes fit the best. 
   The package contains functions to transform archaeobotanical datasets, conduct LDA and then plot the data against the ethnographic data as 2D or 3D plots
