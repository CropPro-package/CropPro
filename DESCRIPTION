Version: 0.1.0
Author: Elizabeth Stroud

Description: This package contains functions for the linear discriminant analysis of ethnographic data against which archaeobotanical data can be classified. The package contains functions to transform archaeobotanical datasets, conduct LDA and then plot the archaeobotanical data against the ethnographic data as 2D or 3D plots. The package contains two LDA functions which allows the archaeobotanical samples to be classified as one of four crop processing stages, or one of five classes (four crop processing stages and the archaeological group)
