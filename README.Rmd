# CropPro

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository stores the CropPro package. CropPro contains functions which can be used to classify archaeobotanical data against a linear discriminant model derived from ethnographic data on the by-products of crop processing stages. The package contains two linear discriminant analysis (LDA) functions that can be used to classify the archaeobotanical samples as one of four crop processing stages, or one of five classes (four crop processing stages and the archaeological group) and then plot them as two-dimensional or three-dimensional graphs. This package also contains a function for the data transformation required before LDA can be conducted, as well as a function for plotting the ratio of grain to chaff to weed seeds in comparison to ethnographic data.

## Referencing

The CropPro package draws on data from ethnographic research conducted on the Greek island of Amorgos. The models were developed by Jones (1984, 1987, 1990) and Charles (1997).

When publishing results obtained from the use of the CropPro package please cite the package and its version, as well as the ethnographic data. A best practice example paragraph is provided in Stroud *et al*. (2023).

## Installation

You can install the development version of CropPro from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elizabethastroud/Cropprocessing")
```

## Crop processing LDA example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the package to understand crop processing stage represented within an archaeobotanical assemblage :

```{r example}
library(CropPro)
## basic example code
# Sample data
species<-c("Chenopodium album" , "Anthemis cotula", "Brassica rapa ssp campestris",
"Raphanus raphanistrum", "Agrostemma githago" , "Poa annua" )
category<-c("SFH", "BHH","SFH","BHH","BFH", "SFL" )
s.1246<-c(2,2,3,7,1, 6)
s.46178<-c(1,1,0,0,2,5)
s.1<-c(0,2,2,8,1,8)
s.23<-c(0,3,2,3,0,0)
s.987<-c(3,9,6,8,0,1 )
dataset<-data.frame(species,category,s.1246,s.46178,s.1,s.23,s.987)
dataset
```

The sample data, showing species, classification and 5 different samples : s.1246, s.46178, s.1, s.23, s.987, needs to be transformed and transposed for the LDA. The function crop.dataorg can do that.

```{r}
data<-crop.dataorg(dataset, codes=2, samples=3)
data
```

The organised data can then be analysed using LDAcrop.pro which will classify the data against the ethnographic model.

```{r}
results<-LDAcrop.pro(data)
```

The results from LDAcrop.pro can be plotted as either a static 2D or interactive 3D graph.

```{r}
crop.plot2D(results)
```

```{r}
crop.plot3D(results)

```

## LDA.plus example

There are alternative functions within the package which allow for classification of the entered data against a model constructed from the ethnographic data **and** the entered data. This provides the LDA an alternative group of "archaeological" when classifying the entered data. The workflow is similar to above, except with the use of the "dung" suite of functions: LDAcrop.plus, crop.plus_plot2D, crop.plus_plot3D.

```{r}
plus_results<-LDAcrop.plus(data)
crop.plus_plot2D(plus_results)
crop.plus_plot3D(plus_results)
```
